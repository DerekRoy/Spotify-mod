# Spotify-mod
Organizes and breaks down Spotify data set by danceability rating of Drake songs.  Importing a Spotify data set using the open() command, this program reads line by line through the file using a for loop. Before entering the for loop a list is created to store drake songs. Through each iteration unnecessary information like commas are removed and the line is tokenized into list of substrings split by spaces. Artist, song, and danceability variables are set to specific values of the sub string list, and then artist is checked to see if it is Drake and if it does then a tuple called record is created to store artist, song, and danceability  variables and is then added to the Drake list. Using the datum variable the drake list is then printed by danceability, artist, and song.    This project was done to utilize big data augmentation and analysis for some means. To test skills in organizing data sets, extracting information, and returning specific values.
